2. BasedAgent Referrence Implementation a contributios falls under. The BARIs list is [here](insert)
3. The Ethereum wallet address to be rewarded.
4. Handle of a contributor GitHub.
5. Full description of a contribution.
6. Proof of the Code Contribution (this may be a commit or PR).
7. Amount of [weights](insert) requested (as a number â€“ do not include the word "weights").
8. Weight Time. The number of snapshots for which the weights will be considered in emissions. Leave blank if it's for the maximum amount.

<b>Snapshot | MRI | Wallet Address | GitHub Handle | Description of Contribution | Proof | Weights Requested | Weight Time</b>
<br><br>
<b>1 | 3 | 0xf93de9fb07f5762a1e3db9a5c687595111928d77 | my GH name | "code does: this" | "http:// Link to proof" | 1250 | 6</b>

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Create a pull request and add a row to the following table.
> - Only one BARI per entry.
> - If you are submitting multiple contributions, please create multiple pull requests - one pull request per contribution.
> - Only add your link at the bottom, and do not alter any other rows.
> - Detail the work you are contributing to Based Agent. You must include a link to the work for the work to be considered. Examples of proof include links to pull requests, github issues, or other easily verifyable information.
> - It is your responsibility to make the proof easily verifiable. Don't assume reviewers of this table have an understanding of your code. Explain it simply. Limit your descriptions to 250 words.
> - You need a wallet like Metamask that can receive Ethereum based tokens. BAAAG is an ERC-20 type token. Also must support Arbitrum.
