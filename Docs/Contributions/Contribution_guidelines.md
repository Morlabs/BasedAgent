## Contribution Types

Based Agent welcomes three types of contributions: bounties, freestyle, and recurring roles.

### Bounties

Bounties are predefined tasks with a specific scope of work and a clear form of deliverable. They provide a structured way for contributors to engage with the project. Here's how you can get involved with bounties:

1. **Browse Existing Bounties**: Check the list of available bounties [here](https://app.wonderverse.xyz/pod/124525901772751121/boards?entity=bounty) to find tasks that match your skills and interests.
3. **Claim a Bounty**: Once you find a bounty you'd like to work on, claim it by notifying the relevant Repo Lead or following the project-specific procedure.
4. **Complete the Work**: Develop, test, and document your solution according to the bounty's requirements.
5. **Submit Your Work**: Submit your work through the designated process, which typically involves a pull request (PR) and filling out a submission form with your details.
6. **Review and Feedback**: Engage in the code review process, address any feedback or suggestions, and finalize your submission.

Contributors can also propose their own bounties, which, if approved, will be listed alongside other available tasks.

### Freestyle Contributions

Freestyle contributions are one-time efforts that address a specific issue, feature, or improvement. These contributions can be made by anyone, regardless of their level of involvement with the project. To submit a freestyle contribution:

1. Identify an open issue, feature request, or improvement opportunity.
2. Fork the project's repository and create a new branch for your contribution.
3. Develop, test, and document your changes.
4. Submit a pull request (PR) with a clear description of your changes and their impact.
5. Engage in the code review process and address any feedback or suggestions.
6. Submit your contribution on the Freestyle contributions table for [Code](https://github.com/Morlabs/BasedAgent/blob/main/Contribute/code.md) or [Community](https://github.com/Morlabs/BasedAgent/blob/main/Contribute/community.md), depending on the type of contribution. 

### Recurring Roles

Recurring roles are for ongoing contributions made by individuals who have been approved as recurring contributors. These contributors take on specific roles or responsibilities within the project and contribute regularly. To become a recurring contributor:

1. Demonstrate your commitment and skills by successfully completing at least three bounties or freestyle contributions.
2. Express your interest in becoming a recurring contributor to the relevant Repo Lead.
3. Discuss the available roles, responsibilities, and expectations with the relevant Repo Lead.
4. Once approved, commit to contributing to the project on a recurring basis, as agreed upon with the relevant Repo Lead.

## Contribution Workflow

Let's look at an example of how to contribute to Based Agent:

1. A contributor wants to translate the whitepaper from English to Spanish as they notice there is currently no Spanish translation available on the relevant Github repo.
2. They go on Discord to create a new thread in the "Contributions" channel to let community members know they intend to work on this. They may have additional questions related to the task, such as where to submit, who will be reviewing, or any other information they can't find. As a rule, it's good to do this first, but you can also just go ahead and do the work first; it's up to you.
3. They do the work and translate the whitepaper.
4. They submit the work on the relevant contributions table. In this case, the whitepaper falls within the "Community Pool".
5. It took the contributor 2 hours to complete this work, and they value their time at $30 per hour. So that would be $60. They enter their ETH address, proof of work, description of work, $60, sub-dao = community, on the contributions table.
6. The Repo Lead of the Community Sub-DAO reviews the submission. They either approve it or amend it. They may or may not give feedback to the contributorâ€”it's at their discretion.
7. At the end of the month, a snapshot is taken of the contributions that month. Let's say there are $10,000 worth of contributions that month in the Community Sub-DAO. And the Community Sub-DAO receives an emission of 100,000 BAAG tokens from the Parent DAO in a given month. That means the contributor would earn (60/10,000)*100,000 = 600 BAAG tokens for their contribution.

## Communication and Collaboration

Effective communication and collaboration are essential for the success of the Based Agent project. Here are some guidelines to follow:

- Be respectful, inclusive, and professional in all interactions with other contributors and community members.
- Use clear and concise language when communicating ideas, proposals, or feedback.
- Be open to constructive criticism and be willing to iterate on your contributions based on feedback.
- Collaborate with other contributors, share knowledge, and help each other grow and learn.
- Use the project's designated communication channels, such as chat platforms, forums, or mailing lists, to stay updated and engaged with the community.

## Recognition and Rewards

Based Agent values and recognizes the contributions of its community members. While the project operates on a voluntary basis, there may be opportunities for rewards, incentives, or recognition for significant contributions. The relevant Repo Lead will communicate any such opportunities as they arise.

Please note that Repo Leads will be elected by token holders after the initial term, ensuring a decentralized and community-driven governance structure.

We appreciate your dedication and efforts in contributing to Based Agent. Together, we can build a decentralized future where humans and AI collaborate harmoniously and transparently.

If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out to the relevant Repo Lead or the community. Happy contributing!
