# Bounty ID 6 - Develop Onboarding Page for Ingesting Project Information

## Overview

### Bounty Title
Develop an onboarding page for new organizations to select information sources for BasedAgent to ingest.

### Bounty Description
Design and build an onboarding page for new organizations where they can select which information sources they want BasedAgent to ingest. This will help BasedAgent submit high-quality code for their project. The primary sources of interest are coding-related, such as GitHub, GitLab, and technical documentation. Other information sources can also be considered but are secondary.

### Objectives
- Develop an onboarding page where organizations can select information sources for ingestion.
- Implement functionality to ingest selected information sources.
- Propose and integrate a model for training a custom version using the organization's data.
- Ensure the design and user experience are consistent with the basedagent.co website.

### Acceptance Criteria
- The onboarding page should allow organizations to:
  - Select and connect GitHub repositories.
  - Upload technical documentation.
  - Optionally select other information sources.
- Implement backend functionality to ingest data from the selected sources.
- Propose the best model for this task (e.g., Llama 3.1 405b) and outline the method for training a custom version using the organization's data.
- Ensure the page is responsive and visually consistent with the basedagent.co design.

## Deliverables
- A fully functional onboarding page integrated with the backend for data ingestion.
- Source code repository (preferably GitHub) with clear instructions on how to deploy the page.
- Documentation outlining the ingestion process, model selection, and training method.
- A demo URL where the onboarding page can be tested.

## Technical Requirements
- Frontend: React
- Backend: Node.js,Express
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Data Ingestion: Integration with GitHub, and file upload for technical documentation

## Proposed Model and Training Method
- **Model**: Llama 3.1 405b
- **Training Method**:
  - Collect data from the selected sources (GitHub, GitLab, technical documentation).
  - Preprocess the data to format it suitably for training.
  - Fine-tune the Llama 3.1 405b model using the preprocessed data.
  - Validate the model to ensure it can generate high-quality code and suggestions based on the ingested data.
  - Implement regular updates and retraining based on new data ingested.
