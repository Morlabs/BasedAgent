# BasedAgent Bounty Reward Program Guide

This document outlines the Bounty Reward Program within the BasedAgent community. The program is designed to incentivize the creation and completion of impactful bounties that drive the project's development forward.

## Understanding Bounties in the BasedAgent Ecosystem

Bounties in the BasedAgent ecosystem are defined as small-scale tasks aimed at contributing to the project through new feature developments, enhancements, or bug fixes. These tasks are:

- **Strategically important**: Identified as key contributions by BARI maintainers.
- **Short-term tasks**: Expected not to last longer than 1 month for a single developer.
- **Well-defined**: Each bounty comes with detailed descriptions including scope, expected outcomes, and necessary skills which helps ensure clarity and focus in execution.

Bounties are distinct from typical GitHub Issues due to their strategic importance and the clearer certainty that they align with the project's goals.

## Commission Structure for Bounty Creation

### Commission Description
The commission for creating a bounty is set at 10% of the weights awarded to the bounty. This commission is earned for each snapshot over which the bounty weights are distributed. The duration of these snapshots can vary based on the bounty's terms.

### Example

#### Scenario
Charlie creates a bounty that is approved to award a total of 500 weights per snapshot for a duration of 5 snapshots.

#### Commission Calculation
- **Total Weights Awarded**: 500 weights per snapshot
- **Duration of Distribution**: 5 snapshots
- **Commission Rate**: 10%

Charlie’s commission for creating the bounty is calculated as follows:
- 10% of 500 weights = 50 weights per snapshot

#### Commission Distribution
Charlie will receive 50 weights each snapshot for the duration of 5 snapshots, totaling 250 weights over the period.

This commission model incentivizes the creation of valuable and impactful bounties by rewarding the creator with a share of the weights that reflects their contribution to the project’s development over the duration of the bounty's activity.

## Submitting a Bounty

### Understand the Requirements
Each bounty is accompanied by detailed descriptions that outline the scope, expected outcomes, and necessary skills required to complete the task successfully.

### Submit Proposals
If you identify an opportunity to contribute, or if you have a new initiative idea, prepare and submit a detailed proposal using the following form:

Your proposal should outline your planned approach and the potential impact, aiming to clearly communicate how it aligns with the strategic goals of the BasedAgent project.

## Conclusion

The Bounty Reward Program is a critical component of the BasedAgent community’s strategy to foster innovation and drive project development. By providing clear incentives and detailed guidelines, we aim to cultivate a culture of excellence where community members are empowered to contribute effectively.
