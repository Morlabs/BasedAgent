**BasedAgent: Revolutionizing Web3 and Decentralized AI Development with Autonomous AI Code Contributions**

---

## Introduction

BasedAgent is an advanced AI coding assistant designed to autonomously contribute high-quality code to a wide array of Web3 and decentralized AI projects. Starting with Morpheus as its pilot project, BasedAgent plans to expand its reach across the digital ecosystem, enhancing both its utility and impact.

## Tokenomics and Reward Distribution

### Total Token Supply
- **Total Supply:** 42,000,000 tokens, carefully capped to ensure scarcity and maintain value.
- **Fair Launch:** No pre-mine and no early token sale, ensuring a fair and equitable distribution from the outset.

### Emissions Schedule
- **Daily Emissions:** Begin at 14,400 tokens per day.
- **Decay Rate:** Decrease by 2.468994701 tokens each day, targeting a gradual phase-out over approximately 16 years (5,833 days), transitioning to a fee-based model as the primary incentive mechanism.

### Distribution Allocation
- **Coders:** 50% (7,200 tokens per day) covering BARIs 1-8
- **Capital:** 30% (4,320 tokens per day)
- **Community:** 16% (2,304 tokens per day) covering BARIs 9-10
- **Protection Pool:** 4% (576 tokens per day)

## BasedAgent Reference Implementations (BARIs)

BARIs guide BasedAgent's development and application across various sectors within the Web3 and decentralized AI ecosystems, ensuring robust support and continuous innovation:

1. **Smart Contracts on Ethereum / Arbitrum** (Covered by Coders Pool)
2. **AI Model Development and Training** (Covered by Coders Pool)
3. **Local Installations for Desktop / Mobile** (Covered by Coders Pool)
4. **Tokenomics and Economic Model** (Covered by Coders Pool)
5. **Security and Risk Management** (Covered by Coders Pool)
6. **Data Management and Analytics** (Covered by Coders Pool)
7. **Infrastructure and DevOps** (Covered by Coders Pool)
8. **Frontend Development and UI/UX Design** (Covered by Coders Pool)
9. **Community Engagement and Education** (Covered by Community Pool)
10. **Business Development and Partnerships** (Covered by Community Pool)

Each BARI receives an equal share of its respective pool's daily token allocation. This means each of the first eight BARIs receives an equal portion of the 7,200 tokens allocated to coders, and each of the last two BARIs receives an equal portion of the 2,304 tokens allocated to the community.

## Role of Code Reviewers

Code reviewers are integral to BasedAgentâ€™s development process, offering crucial feedback that sharpens and refines its AI-driven code contributions. This human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning ensures continual improvement and adaptation to new coding challenges.

## Protection Pool

The Protection Pool is dedicated to safeguarding the integrity and security of the BasedAgent network. Allocating 4% of daily emissions to this pool provides a crucial buffer that addresses potential vulnerabilities, supports recovery actions, and maintains network health. This fund is vital for proactive threat management and ensures that BasedAgent can respond effectively to security challenges, preserving user trust and system reliability.

## Expansion Beyond Morpheus

Following the pilot phase with Morpheus, BasedAgent will extend its capabilities to a broader range of Web3 and decentralized AI projects. It will seamlessly integrate project-specific codebases and documentation, enabling productive and relevant code contributions across diverse platforms, thereby significantly enhancing its utility and impact.

## Conclusion

BasedAgent represents a transformative advancement in AI-powered coding for the Web3 and decentralized AI sectors. By delivering continuous, high-quality code contributions and strategically expanding its operations, BasedAgent is set to play a crucial role in the evolution of decentralized technologies. Its well-structured tokenomics and proactive approach to network security underscore its innovative approach to digital collaboration and development.
