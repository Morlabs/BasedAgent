# BasedAgent Vouching Incentive Program Guide

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the Vouching Incentive Program within the BasedAgent community. The program is designed to ensure the integrity and quality of contributions by requiring all new contributors (vouchees) to be endorsed by existing members (vouchers) before they can earn rewards.

## The Vouching Process

### **Step 1: Find a Voucher**
- **Objective**: New contributors must connect with an existing contributor who can vouch for their skills and potential value to the BasedAgent project.
- **Action**: Prospective contributors should engage with community platforms, participate in discussions, and demonstrate their capabilities in relevant areas to attract a voucher.

### **Step 2: Official Vouching**
- **Objective**: Formalize the inclusion of a new contributor into the project.
- **Action**: The existing contributor completes the [Vouching form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdxiRugLBRT1m1gg9mZjv2SgYKfbVaXIUoB3drZCaQLKcL9Vw/viewform?usp=sf_link) to officially endorse the new contributor. This form initiates the integration process, enabling the new contributor to start earning weights.

## Responsibilities and Ledger Transparency

### **Voucher's Responsibility**
- **Impact**: Vouchers bear significant responsibility as the performance of the contributors they vouch for can reflect positively or negatively on them.
- **Incentive**: Vouchers are encouraged to select individuals who are likely to make high-quality, valuable contributions to maintain the project's standards and enhance their own reputation within the community.

### **Public Ledger**
- **Objective**: Ensure transparency and accountability within the community.
- **Description**: A public ledger records all vouching activities, detailing who vouched for whom. This ledger is accessible to all community members and helps maintain a clear line of responsibility and incentive alignment.

## Rewards and Incentives

### **Rewards for Vouchees**
- **Mechanism**: Vouchees earn weights based on the quality and impact of their contributions to the BasedAgent project. These weights directly influence the BAAG token emissions that the contributor is able to claim.

### **Rewards for Vouchers**
- **Incentive Mechanism**: Vouchers receive an incentive equal to 10% of the weights earned by their vouchees. This is intended to motivate vouchers to actively support and mentor their vouchees.
- **Duration**: This reward continues for up to 12 snapshots (monthly periods), capping the incentive period for any given vouchee.

### **Example Scenario**
- **Situation**: Alice, an experienced developer, vouches for Bob, a new developer with potential in smart contract security.
- **Outcome**: Bob successfully integrates into the project and makes significant contributions to BasedAgent's smart contracts. For up to 12 monthly snapshots, Alice receives 10% of the weights earned by Bob from his contributions.

## Conclusion

Vouching for new contributors is a critical gateway for integrating talent into the BasedAgent project and represents a significant commitment from existing contributors. This process ensures all members are motivated to contribute their best efforts, fostering a robust and innovative community environment.

### **Additional Notes**
- **Community Engagement**: Contributors are encouraged to actively participate in community events and discussions to better understand the project's needs and contributor dynamics.
- **Continuous Evaluation**: The Vouching Incentive Program may be subject to periodic reviews to adapt to the evolving needs of the BasedAgent community and the broader ecosystem.
