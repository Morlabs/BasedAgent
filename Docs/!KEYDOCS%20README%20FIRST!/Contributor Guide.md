## 6. Code Contributor Weights & Value
In the BasedAgent ecosystem, the distribution of BAAG emissions to contributors is based on a unique system called "weights." This guide provides a comprehensive overview of how weights are distributed, their implied value, and the overall reward structure for contributions to the BasedAgent project.

### Understanding Weights

Weights are a quantifiable measure used to allocate BAAG emissions among contributors. They are designed to reward contributions based on their value and impact on the BasedAgent ecosystem.

- **Allocation of Weights**: Weights are allocated to contributors based on the significance, necessity, and quality of their contributions. This system ensures that rewards are merit-based and align with the project's goals.
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Weights can be adjusted over time, reflecting the ongoing value of contributions to the project. This means that as the needs of the project change, the value of previous contributions can be reassessed.

### Emissions Schedule & Supply Cap

The total number of weights for both the Code Pool and Community Pool are capped at 100 million, and these weights are distributed over a 16-year period according to a predefined schedule. This long-term plan ensures a stable and predictable release of BAAG, providing sustained incentives for contributors.

- **Initial Distribution**: Initially, weights are distributed more generously to stimulate early participation and development.
- **Gradual Decrease**: Over time, the distribution of weights decreases, encouraging efficient and high-impact contributions early in the project lifecycle.

### Monthly Weights Distribution

Weights are distributed on a monthly basis starting from the project's launch. The monthly distribution for the first year is outlined as follows:

1. July 2024: 6,250,000 weights
2. August 2024: 5,729,167 weights
3. September 2024: 5,208,333 weights
4. October 2024: 4,687,500 weights
5. November 2024: 4,166,667 weights
6. December 2024: 3,645,833 weights
7. January 2025: 3,125,000 weights
8. February 2025: 2,604,167 weights
9. March 2025: 2,083,333 weights
10. April 2025: 1,562,500 weights
11. May 2025: 1,041,667 weights
12. June 2025: 520,833 weights

### Formula for Subsequent Months

For any given month after the first year, the distribution of weights is calculated using the following formula:

```
Monthly Weight Distribution = (13,539,768 × 0.5^(y-2)) × (13-m)/78
```

where \(y\) is the year number starting from 2 for the second year, and \(m\) is the month number from 1 to 12.

### Calculating The Implied Value of Weights

The implied value of weights is calculated based on the current market conditions and the total BAAG emissions:

1. **Total BAAG Emissions**: Determine the total BAAG emissions for the month.
2. **Divide by Total Weights**: Divide the total emissions by the total number of weights to find the value of one weight.
3. **Individual Share**: Multiply the number of weights held by a contributor by the value of one weight to determine their share of BAAG emissions.

### Market Driven Value

The market-driven nature of BAAG means that the value of emissions can fluctuate based on market dynamics and trading activities. Contributors are encouraged to monitor these trends to understand the potential value of their rewards.

## 7. Vouching for Contributors
In the BasedAgent community, each new contributor contributing to the Code or Community Pool must be vouched for by an existing contributor before they can start earning weights. This requirement is crucial for maintaining the integrity and quality of contributions to the project.

### The Vouching Process

To become a contributor:

1. **Find a Voucher**: New contributors must connect with an existing contributor who can vouch for their skills and potential value to the BasedAgent project.
2. **Official Vouching**: The existing contributor formally vouches for the new contributor, initiating their integration into the project by completing the Vouching form.

### Sourcing Fee Entitlement

When an existing contributor vouches for a new member, they are entitled to a sourcing fee. This fee is equivalent to 20% of the weights earned by the new contributor for a period of 6 snapshots. This incentive encourages contributors to onboard valuable individuals from their network, enhancing the project's overall contribution quality.

### Responsibilities and Ledger Transparency

- **Voucher's Responsibility**: Vouchers bear a significant responsibility. The contributions of the new contributors they brought into the project can reflect positively or negatively on them. It is in the interest of the voucher to choose individuals who will make high-quality, valuable contributions.
- **Public Ledger**: A public ledger will record who v

ouched for whom, providing transparency and accountability within the community. This ledger helps maintain a clear line of responsibility and incentive alignment.

### Conclusion

Vouching for a new contributor is not only a gateway for new talents to join BasedAgent but also a serious commitment from existing contributors. It ensures that everyone involved is motivated to bring forth their best efforts, thereby fostering a robust and innovative community.

## 8. Weight Maintenance Guide

### Introduction
In the BasedAgent ecosystem, maintaining contributions is just as important as the initial creation. The GitHub repository maintainer rewards contributions with weights, a crucial component of the protocol development. Weights play a pivotal role in motivating ongoing development and collaboration, serving as an incentive mechanism that underpins the operational expansion of the protocol.

### Weight Acceptance and Maintenance
When a contribution is initially accepted, it is rewarded with weights that reflect its value to the project. However, maintaining these weights involves active engagement with the project to ensure the contribution continues to meet its needs. Maintenance can include updates, bug fixes, improvements, and adaptation to new technologies or project directions.

### At-Risk Weights
If a contribution becomes outdated or no longer meets the project’s standards, the associated weights are considered "at-risk." This status serves as a prompt for contributors to update their contributions to retain their weights.

### The Process for Weight Maintenance
1. **Monthly Snapshots**: Each month, the repo maintainer reviews contributions to identify those needing updates. The results are published in a markdown file listing contributions that are at-risk.
2. **Grace Period**: Contributors whose weights are at-risk have a grace period (usually one month) to update their contributions. This period is crucial for making necessary adjustments without losing the associated rewards.
3. **Update Requirements**: The specific updates required are detailed in the markdown file, including the nature of the maintenance needed and the deadline for completion.
4. **Failure to Update**: If the contributor does not update the contribution within the grace period, the weights may be revoked. This decision is made to ensure that only active and relevant contributions are rewarded.

### Urgent Updates
Occasionally, urgent updates may be required outside the regular review cycle. These could be due to security issues, major bugs, or critical project needs. In such cases, the repo maintainer has the authority to expedite processes and make immediate changes or requests.

### Conclusion
The Weight Maintenance Guide is designed to foster a dynamic and responsive contributing environment. By encouraging regular updates and maintenance, BasedAgent ensures that all contributions remain valuable and effective, supporting the ongoing success and evolution of the project. Contributors are urged to stay engaged and proactive in maintaining their contributions to retain their rewards and continue supporting the BasedAgent ecosystem.
