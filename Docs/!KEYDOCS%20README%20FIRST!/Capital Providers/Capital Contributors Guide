## BasedAgent Capital Contributors Guide

Welcome to the BasedAgent Capital Contributors Guide. This document provides comprehensive information for those interested in contributing capital to the BasedAgent ecosystem, outlining the procedures for deposits, rewards, and management. By becoming a capital provider, you play a crucial role in fueling the project's growth and sustainability.

### Becoming a Capital Provider

To become a capital provider, you need to deposit stETH into the BasedAgent smart contract. stETH is a yield-generating token representing an Ethereum token staked in Lido, which allows you to earn returns while participating in Ethereum's proof-of-stake consensus.

### Deposit Procedures

1. **Where to Deposit**: Deposits should be made on the Ethereum mainnet.
2. **Smart Contract Address**: The verified address for the deposit contract can be found in the #verified-links channel on the [BasedAgent Discord server](https://discord.com/channels/1251220927518216294/1251220928113803268).
3. **Acquiring stETH**: stETH can be directly minted through Lido or purchased from various exchanges.
4. **Minimum and Maximum Deposits**: The minimum deposit is 0.01 stETH, and there is no maximum limit.

### Benefits for BasedAgent from Your Deposit

BasedAgent utilizes the yield generated by stETH to create Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL). Half of this yield is used to buy back BAAG from the open market, which is then combined with the remaining wETH and added to the liquidity pool. This strategy enhances the liquidity and stability of the BAAG token.

### Staking and Withdrawal

- **Lockup and Withdrawal**: Your stETH is not converted into BAAG; only the yield generated is used by the protocol. You can withdraw the full amount of stETH you deposited after a 7-day initial lockup period.
- **No Impermanent Loss Risk**: When you withdraw, you receive the same amount of stETH that you deposited, ensuring that there is no risk of impermanent loss.

### Rewards for Capital Providers

- **Reward Distribution**: 24% of BAAG emissions are allocated to capital providers and divided proportionally based on each provider's share in the total deposited stETH pool.
- **Claiming Rewards**: Rewards can be claimed via the dashboard at [https://dashboard.basedagent.co](https://dashboard.basedagent.co). Simply connect your wallet used for the stETH deposit, check the claimable BAAG amount, and complete the transaction to receive your tokens on the Arbitrum chain.

### Security and Management

- **Contract Audits**: The stETH deposit contract has been thoroughly audited by the Morpheus community and professional cybersecurity firms. Audit reports are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/MOR20?tab=readme-ov-file).
- **Multisig Management**: The deposit contract is managed by a 4 of 7 multisig, controlled by trusted community contributors. Details about the multisig setup are available [here](insert).
