## Contribution Provider - Proof of Contribution Table for Code Contribution

**Before adding a pull request to this table [please read the BEST PRACTICES GUIDE](https://github.com/Morlabs/BasedAgent/blob/main/Contribute/contribution_guidelines.md)**

**Every contribution must include the date of contribution under the format day/month/year.**

## Structuring your Code Contributions.
All Code Contributions should include the following six elements:
1. The Ethereum / Wallet address to be rewarded.
2. Link to the Issue being addressed.
3. Link to the Code Contribution.
4. Time spent in hours.
5. Description of Contributions.
6. Date of Contribution (format: day/month/year).

Example fields below: 

| Wallet Address                             | Link to Issue | Link to Work        | Time spent (hours) | Description of Contribution | Date of Contribution |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------- |
| 0x98eFf980C57c9D333340b3856481bF7B8698987c | Link to Issue | Link to Commit #127 | 50                  | Integration of ollama       | 12/03/2024          |

Please include the "pipe" `|` symbol correctly as seen above so your contribution will format with the table.

> [!NOTE]
> - Create a pull request and add a row to the following table.  
> - If you are submitting multiple contributions, please create multiple pull requests - one pull request per contribution.  
> - Only add your link at the bottom, and do not alter any other rows.   
> - Detail the work you are contributing to Morpheus. You must include a link to the work for the work to be considered. Examples of proof include links to pull requests, github issues, or other easily verifiable information.  
> - It is your responsibility to make the proof easily verifiable. Don't assume reviewers of this table have an understanding of your code. Explain it simply. Limit your descriptions to 250 words.
> - You need a wallet like Metamask that can receive Ethereum based tokens. BAAG token is an ERC-20 type token. Also must support Arbitrum.
