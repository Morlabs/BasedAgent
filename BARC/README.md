# Based Agent Request for Comments (BARC)
Proposals to improve any of the Based Agent Reference Implementations (BARIs).  
See the details on all of the MRIs [here](https://github.com/Morlabs/BasedAgent/Docs/Based%20Agent%20Reference%20Implementations%20(BARI).md)

## Meta MRCs about MRCs
- [BARC00](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/MRC/blob/main/MRC00.md) is the first Meta BARC about how to submit a BARC.â€¨
- Similar to the function of the [ERC system](https://eips.ethereum.org/erc ) serves in Ethereum, the BARC process provides a common language to describe interactions between models, agents, compute, payments, funding and so forth.
- There is a dedicated forum on Discord for the discussion of BARCs [here](https://discord.com/channels/1251220927518216294/1265621325020528761).
